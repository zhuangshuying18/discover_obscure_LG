# Discovering Obscure Looking Glass Sites on the Web to Facilitate Internet Measurement Research- Conext2021
1. A full list of obscure and known automatable VPs, together with their IPs, is freely accessible from the website https://zhuangshuying18.github.io/discover_obscure_LG/ to provide convenience for researchers who want to conduct systematic or periodic on-demand measurements.
2. The original data, source code, automation tool, and analysis results of our submitted work can be publicly accessible from http://cybermap.dragonlab.org:33333. The detailed README file (which will be reorganized later) is also included on the website.
# Please Cite Our Paper If You Use The LG List, Thank You!
